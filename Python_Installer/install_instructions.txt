Step-by-step Installation for Hangman Python Client
--------------------------------------------------

1. Install omniORB and omniORBpy:
   - Windows:
     a. Download omniORB and omniORBpy installers from SourceForge.
     b. Run both installers.
     c. Add the omniORB and omniORBpy install directories to your PATH and PYTHONPATH if needed.
   - Linux:
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python3-omniorb omniidl python3-omniorb-omg

2. Generate Python stubs:
   - Open a terminal in the CORBA_IDLs folder.
   - Run: omniidl -bpython GameService.idl
   - Copy the generated GameModule.py and any related files into Client_Python/

3. Install Python dependencies:
   - Open a terminal in Python_Installer.
   - Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the client:
   - Open a terminal in Client_Python.
   - Run: python hangman_client.py

Notes:
- The Python client will only work if the Java server is running and accessible.
- Use the same GameService.idl for both Java and Python stubs.
